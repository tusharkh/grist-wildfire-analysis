A quick analysis of the 2022 wildfire season for Grist's Data Fellowship interview

Check out the [analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/tusharkh/grist-wildfire-analysis/blob/main/analysis.ipynb) jupyter notebook for a detailed look at how I approached the problem.

## Paragraph description
Wildfires are off to an exceptionally fast start in 2022. In the last 20 years, only 2006 and 2011 saw larger acreages burned this early in the year. Intense early seasons in the Southwest and Southeast have fueled the inferno, accounting for 88% of the total acreage burned. Nevertheless, peak wildfire season in much of the country is yet to arrive, and federal agencies remind us that regional variations in temperatures, combustible biomass, wind patterns, and rainfall make it difficult to say whether this trend will continue. While prolonged drought conditions have Californian's worried, other state agencies are hoping that this year will bring fewer fires than 2021. 2022 was certainly a record-breaking wildfire year for New Mexico, but it is probably too early to say whether the season will continue to be exceptional throughout the year and in the rest of the country.
