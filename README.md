A quick analysis of the 2022 wildfire season for Grist's Data Fellowship interview

Check out the [analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/tusharkh/grist-wildfire-analysis/blob/main/analysis.ipynb) jupyter notebook for a detailed look at how I approached the problem.

## Paragraph description
Wildfires are off to an exceptionally fast start in 2022. In the last 20 years, only 2006 and 2011 saw larger acreages burned this early in the year. Intense early fires in the Southwest and Southeast have fueled the inferno, accounting for 88% of the total acreage burned. Nevertheless, peak wildfire season in much of the country is yet to arrive and regional variations in temperatures, combustible biomass, wind patterns, and rainfall could change the course of the season. Based on predictive fire modeling, the [National Interagency Fire Center](https://www.predictiveservices.nifc.gov/outlooks/outlooks.htm) suggests that peak fire season in much of the country will be above average, but some state agencies still think that this year will bring fewer fires than 2021. 2022 was certainly a record-breaking wildfire year for New Mexico, and while it will likely be an above average year throughout the country, it is probably too early to say whether the season will continue to break records throughout the year and in the rest of the US.
